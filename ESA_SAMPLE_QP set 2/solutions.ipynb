    "Perfect — let’s tackle this systematically. You’ve uploaded the **exam paper schema** for *Databases & SQL (MTech)*. I’ll walk through **Section A, B, and C** one by one, giving clear answers with reasoning, SQL examples, and business interpretation where needed.  \n",

    "# ✅ SECTION A (Conceptual, 20 Marks)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1(a) Primary Key vs Candidate Key\n",
    "- **Primary Key**: A unique identifier chosen from candidate keys. Only one per table, cannot be NULL.\n",
    "- **Candidate Key**: Any column(s) that can uniquely identify a row. A table can have multiple candidate keys.\n",
    "👉 Example: In `Employee(Employee_id, Email)`, both `Employee_id` and `Email` are candidate keys, but only one becomes the primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1(b) WHERE vs GROUP BY\n",
    "- **WHERE**: Filters rows *before* grouping/aggregation.  \n",
    "- **GROUP BY**: Groups rows into sets for aggregation functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG).  \n",
    "👉 Example:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT department, COUNT(*) \n",
    "FROM employees \n",
    "WHERE salary > 5000 \n",
    "GROUP BY department;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, `WHERE` filters salaries first, then `GROUP BY` counts per department.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1(c) DROP VIEW & Updating Views\n",
    "- `DROP VIEW view_name;` → Deletes the view definition, not the base tables.  \n",
    "- **Updating Views**: Possible only if the view is based on a single table without aggregates, DISTINCT, GROUP BY, or joins. Otherwise, not updatable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1(d) EXISTS Operator\n",
    "- Checks if a subquery returns rows. Returns TRUE if at least one row exists.  \n",
    "👉 Example:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT employee_name \n",
    "FROM employees e \n",
    "WHERE EXISTS (\n",
    "  SELECT 1 FROM projects p WHERE p.employee_id = e.employee_id\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "This lists employees assigned to projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1(e) RANK() vs DENSE_RANK()\n",
    "- **RANK()**: Leaves gaps when ties occur.  \n",
    "- **DENSE_RANK()**: No gaps; next rank is consecutive.  \n",
    "👉 Example:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT employee_name, salary,\n",
    "       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rnk,\n",
    "       DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS dense_rnk\n",
    "FROM employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "If two employees share 2nd place, RANK jumps to 4, DENSE_RANK goes to 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2(a) Joins vs Subqueries\n",
    "Use **joins** when:\n",
    "- You need data from multiple tables simultaneously.\n",
    "- Performance matters (joins are optimized).\n",
    "- You want to combine related rows.  \n",
    "Subqueries are better for filtering or existence checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2(b) Types of Locks\n",
    "- **Shared Lock (S)**: Multiple reads allowed, no writes.  \n",
    "- **Exclusive Lock (X)**: Only one transaction can modify.  \n",
    "- **Update Lock (U)**: Prevents deadlock during updates.  \n",
    "- **Intent Locks**: Signals intention to acquire locks at lower granularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2(c) Check Constraints\n",
    "- Can be applied at **column level** or **table level**.  \n",
    "- Works on numeric, string, and date types.  \n",
    "👉 Example:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "salary INT CHECK (salary > 0);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2(d) Dropping a Table\n",
    "- Drops **columns, constraints, indexes, defaults**.  \n",
    "- Does **NOT** drop views or stored procedures (they reference the table but remain unless explicitly dropped).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2(e) Multi-row Operators\n",
    "- **IN, ANY, ALL** are multi-row operators.  \n",
    "👉 Example:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT employee_name \n",
    "FROM employees \n",
    "WHERE salary IN (SELECT salary FROM managers);\n",
    "```\n",
