    "Perfect — you’ve provided the schema and data for **warehouse_employees**, and the ESA paper has three sections (A: theory, B: SQL queries on warehouse_employees, C: SQL queries on sales schema). Let’s go through **all questions neatly, with clear answers and code**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# 📘 SECTION A – Theory (20 Marks)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1a. Difference between Primary Key and Unique Key\n",
    "- **Primary Key**: Uniquely identifies each row in a table. Cannot contain NULL values. Only one per table.\n",
    "- **Unique Key**: Ensures all values in a column are unique. Can contain a single NULL. Multiple unique keys allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1b. Difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE\n",
    "- **DELETE TABLE**: Removes rows one by one, can have `WHERE` clause, logs each deletion, slower.\n",
    "- **TRUNCATE TABLE**: Removes all rows instantly, cannot use `WHERE`, resets auto-increment, faster, minimal logging.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1c. Transaction & ACID Properties\n",
    "- **Transaction**: A sequence of SQL operations treated as a single logical unit of work.\n",
    "- **ACID**:\n",
    "  - **Atomicity**: All or nothing.\n",
    "  - **Consistency**: Preserves database integrity.\n",
    "  - **Isolation**: Transactions don’t interfere.\n",
    "  - **Durability**: Changes persist after commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1d. Concatenate Function in MySQL\n",
    "- `CONCAT(str1, str2, …)` → joins strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1e. Rename Table\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "RENAME TABLE old_table TO new_table;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2a. View in MySQL\n",
    "- **View**: Virtual table based on query result.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE VIEW view_name AS SELECT ...;\n",
    "DROP VIEW view_name;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2b. Commit & Rollback\n",
    "- **COMMIT**: Saves transaction permanently.\n",
    "- **ROLLBACK**: Undoes transaction to last commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2c. Error in Query\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT department_id, count(*)\n",
    "FROM department\n",
    "WHERE count(*) > 5\n",
    "GROUP BY department_id;\n",
    "```\n",
    "❌ Wrong: `WHERE` cannot use aggregate functions.  \n",
    "✅ Correct:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT department_id, COUNT(*)\n",
    "FROM department\n",
    "GROUP BY department_id\n",
    "HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2d. Cross Join\n",
    "- Produces Cartesian product of two tables (all combinations of rows).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2e. Types of Normalization\n",
    "- **1NF**: Atomic values, no repeating groups.\n",
    "- **2NF**: 1NF + no partial dependency.\n",
    "- **3NF**: 2NF + no transitive dependency.\n",
    "- **BCNF**: Stronger form of 3NF, every determinant is a candidate key.\n",
