    "Perfect — let’s tackle this systematically. Since your uploaded exam paper covers **SQL theory (Section A)**, **applied queries (Section B)**, and **advanced SQL with analytical functions/views (Section C)**, I’ll answer each question clearly with examples and reasoning.  \n",

    "# ✅ SECTION A – 20 Marks (Conceptual + Basic SQL)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1(a) Unique Key vs Primary Key\n",
    "- **Primary Key**:  \n",
    "  - Ensures uniqueness and **no NULLs**.  \n",
    "  - Only one per table.  \n",
    "  - Used to uniquely identify each row.  \n",
    "- **Unique Key**:  \n",
    "  - Ensures uniqueness but **allows one NULL**.  \n",
    "  - Multiple unique keys can exist in a table.  \n",
    "- **Example**:  \n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  CREATE TABLE Employee (\n",
    "      EmpID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "      Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,\n",
    "      Phone VARCHAR(15) UNIQUE\n",
    "  );\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  Here, `EmpID` is the primary key, while `Email` and `Phone` are unique keys.\n",

    "### 1(b) Find Duplicate Emails\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT Email, COUNT(*) AS DuplicateCount\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1(d) Group By with NULLs\n",
    "Yes, `GROUP BY` can be applied on a column with duplicates and NULLs.  \n",
    "- NULLs are treated as a single group.  \n",
    "- Example:  \n",
    "  ```sql\n",

    "- **Constraints**: PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, CHECK, NOT NULL.\n",
