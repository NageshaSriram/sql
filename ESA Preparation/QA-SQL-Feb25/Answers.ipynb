    "## Section A: Theory Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1a. Primary Key vs Candidate Key\n",
    "Question: State the difference between Primary key and candidate key​\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: A candidate key is any attribute or set of attributes that uniquely identifies each row in a table and can potentially serve as the primary key. A primary key is one specific candidate key chosen to enforce uniqueness and is used as the main identifier for the table, preventing NULL values and duplicate entries.​\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1b. String Functions\n",
    "Question: Explain any two string functions with an example​\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: CONCAT() combines multiple strings into one (e.g., SELECT CONCAT(FirstName, ' ', LastName) AS FullName FROM customers;). SUBSTRING() extracts a portion of a string (e.g., SELECT SUBSTRING('Hello World', 1, 5) AS Result; returns 'Hello').​\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1c. Aggregate Functions in WHERE\n",
    "Question: Can we use aggregate functions in where clause? Justify your answer​\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: No, aggregate functions like COUNT(), SUM() cannot be used directly in WHERE because WHERE filters rows before grouping. Use HAVING clause instead for post-grouping filters (e.g., SELECT department, COUNT(*) FROM employees GROUP BY department HAVING COUNT(*) > 5).​\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1d. Cross-Join Definition\n",
    "Question: What is Cross-Join?​\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: CROSS JOIN produces a Cartesian product of two tables, combining every row from the first table with every row from the second, resulting in rows × columns total rows without any matching condition.​\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1e. Filtering GROUP BY Results\n",
    "Question: Aryan, a database administrator, has grouped records of a table with the help of group by clause. He needs to further filter groups of records generated through group by clause. Suggest suitable clause for it and properly explain its usage with the help of an example​\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Use HAVING clause. HAVING filters aggregated groups after GROUP BY (e.g., SELECT city, AVG(salary) FROM employees GROUP BY city HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000;) while WHERE filters individual rows before grouping.​\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2a. Window Functions Uses\n",
    "Question: What are the uses of Window Function?​\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Window functions perform calculations across row sets related to the current row without collapsing rows (uses: ranking with ROW_NUMBER(), running totals with SUM() OVER(), percentiles with PERCENT_RANK()).​\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2b. EXISTS Operator\n",
    "Question: Explain about EXISTS operator​\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: EXISTS tests if a subquery returns any rows, returning TRUE if at least one row exists (efficient for checking existence; e.g., SELECT * FROM customers WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM orders WHERE orders.customer_id = customers.id)).​\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2c. Percent Rank\n",
    "Question: What is percent rank? Explain with an example​\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: PERCENT_RANK() returns relative rank as a value between 0 and 1 within a window (e.g., SELECT name, salary, PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary) FROM employees; shows 0 for lowest, 1 for highest salary percentile).​\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2d. Database Locks Types\n",
    "Question: State and explain in brief types of Locks in database​\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: Shared Lock (allows multiple reads, blocks writes), Exclusive Lock (blocks all access for writes), Update Lock (allows reads, converts to exclusive for updates) manage concurrent access.​\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2e. Column Data Restrictions\n",
    "Question: Explain the different ways you can restrict the data in a column. Demonstrate with Examples​\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: CHECK constraint (CHECK (age >= 18)), NOT NULL, DEFAULT (age INT DEFAULT 0), FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE enforce restrictions.​\n"
