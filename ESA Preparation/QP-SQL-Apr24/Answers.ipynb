    "### Q1 a) How to add foreign keys in MySQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "In MySQL, a foreign key is added either at table creation time using the FOREIGN KEY clause in CREATE TABLE, or later using ALTER TABLE with ADD CONSTRAINT FOREIGN KEY that references the parent table’s primary (or unique) key. The child column(s) and the referenced parent column(s) must have compatible data types and indexing for the constraint to be valid.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Example (creating with foreign key):\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE orders (\n",
    "    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    customer_id INT,\n",
    "    CONSTRAINT fk_orders_customer\n",
    "        FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example (adding later):\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE orders\n",
    "ADD CONSTRAINT fk_orders_customer\n",
    "    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id);\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "A foreign key enforces referential integrity by ensuring that a value in the child table exists in the parent table’s referenced column, preventing creation of orphan records. MySQL can also be configured with ON DELETE and ON UPDATE actions (CASCADE, RESTRICT, SET NULL, etc.) to control what happens when the parent key is modified or deleted.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q1 b) What are the levels at which check constraints can be created? Justify your answer on what all data types the constraints can be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "In MySQL 8.0 and later, CHECK constraints can be defined at the column level (directly on a single column definition) and at the table level (as a separate constraint that can involve one or more columns). CHECK conditions are Boolean expressions and can be applied to any data type that participates in logical comparisons, including numeric, character, date/time, and Boolean-like columns, as long as the expression evaluates to TRUE or UNKNOWN for valid rows.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Example – column level:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "    salary DECIMAL(10,2)\n",
    "        CHECK (salary > 0)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "Example – table level:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE orders (\n",
    "    qty INT,\n",
    "    price DECIMAL(10,2),\n",
    "    CHECK (qty >= 0 AND price >= 0)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "A column-level CHECK typically restricts values for that single column, while a table-level CHECK can reference multiple columns to enforce more complex rules (for example, qty * price > 0). Data types such as INT, DECIMAL, VARCHAR, DATE, and DATETIME can all be validated using comparisons, ranges, IN-lists, and functions, provided the expression is deterministic and supported by MySQL’s CHECK implementation.  \n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q1 c) What is the difference between isnull operator() and ifnull() function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "In MySQL, IS NULL is a logical operator used in WHERE, JOIN, or conditional expressions to test whether a column value is NULL and returns TRUE or FALSE, while IFNULL(expr1, expr2) is a function that returns expr2 when expr1 is NULL, otherwise returns expr1. IS NULL does not change the value, it only checks for NULL, whereas IFNULL is used for value substitution to avoid NULL in result sets or calculations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Example – IS NULL:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM employees\n",
    "WHERE manager_id IS NULL;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example – IFNULL:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT IFNULL(commission, 0) AS commission_value\n",
    "FROM employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "Use IS NULL in predicates when filtering rows based on the presence or absence of NULL values, such as in WHERE or ON clauses. Use IFNULL when you need to replace NULL with a default value (for example, turning NULL commission into 0) so that aggregates, arithmetic expressions, or display columns do not propagate NULL.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q1 d) Is it possible to have two primary keys in a table? Explain what is meant by alternate keys in RDBMS with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "It is not possible to have two separate primary keys in a single MySQL table; a table can have only one PRIMARY KEY constraint, which may consist of one or more columns (a composite primary key). However, a table can have multiple candidate keys defined via UNIQUE constraints, and all candidate keys that are not chosen as the primary key are called alternate keys.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE students (\n",
    "    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,\n",
    "    phone VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "In the above example, student_id, email, and phone are all candidate keys because each can uniquely identify a row, but only student_id is chosen as the primary key. The remaining UNIQUE columns (email and phone) act as alternate keys and still enforce uniqueness for their respective attributes. Alternate keys improve data integrity by preventing duplicate values in important identification columns other than the primary key.  \n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q1 e) What is a view? Mention differences between Simple and Complex view.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "A view in MySQL is a virtual table defined by a stored SELECT query whose result set can be queried like a regular table, but the data is not physically stored; instead, it reflects data from the underlying base tables each time it is accessed. Views can encapsulate complex joins, filters, and calculations, providing logical abstraction and security by exposing only selected columns and rows.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Differences between Simple and Complex view:\n",
    "- Simple view:\n",
    "  - Based on a single base table.\n",
    "  - Typically does not contain GROUP BY, DISTINCT, aggregate functions, or subqueries.\n",
    "  - Often updatable (subject to MySQL’s updatability rules).\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    CREATE VIEW active_customers AS\n",
    "    SELECT customer_id, customer_name\n",
    "    FROM customers\n",
    "    WHERE status = 'ACTIVE';\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complex view:\n",
    "  - Based on multiple tables or involves joins, subqueries, GROUP BY, UNION, or aggregate functions.\n",
    "  - Often not directly updatable because of derived or aggregated data.\n",
    "  - Used primarily for reporting and analytics rather than direct DML.\n",
    "  - Example:\n",
    "    CREATE VIEW region_sales_summary AS\n",
    "    SELECT region, SUM(sales) AS total_sales\n",
    "    FROM orders\n",
    "    GROUP BY region;\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "Views help hide underlying schema complexity, enforce column-level security, and provide reusable query logic. Simple views closely mirror a single table’s structure, whereas complex views are designed for summarized or combined data, often trading updatability for richer analytical power.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2 a) What are the uses of Window Function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "In MySQL, window functions compute values across sets of rows that are related to the current row, without collapsing them into a single summary row, using the OVER() clause. They are used for running totals, moving averages, rankings, percentiles, lag/lead comparisons, and partition-based analytics while still returning one row per input row.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "    customer_id,\n",
    "    order_date,\n",
    "    amount,\n",
    "    SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date) AS running_total\n",
    "FROM orders;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "Unlike GROUP BY aggregates, window functions allow analytical calculations to be performed “over” a window (partition and order) while retaining full row-level detail. This enables powerful time-series and comparative analysis such as rank within a partition, row-numbering, and frame-based aggregates within the same SELECT.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2 b) Explain about EXISTS operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "The EXISTS operator in MySQL is used in subqueries to test whether the subquery returns at least one row; it evaluates to TRUE if the subquery yields any row and FALSE otherwise. EXISTS is often used with correlated subqueries to check the existence of related data in another table without needing to retrieve actual column values from the subquery.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT c.customer_id, c.customer_name\n",
    "FROM customers c\n",
    "WHERE EXISTS (\n",
    "    SELECT 1\n",
    "    FROM orders o\n",
    "    WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "EXISTS is semantically a Boolean existence test and can be more efficient than IN for correlated checks, because the subquery can stop searching as soon as a matching row is found. It is commonly used to implement “where related rows exist / do not exist” logic, such as listing customers who have at least one order or those who have no orders (using NOT EXISTS).  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2 c) What is percent rank? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "PERCENT_RANK is a window function that computes the relative rank of a row within a partition as a value between 0 and 1, defined as (rank - 1) / (total_rows_in_partition - 1), giving 0 for the first row and 1 for the last row (when there is more than one row). It shows the position of each row as a fraction of the total, useful for percentile-style analysis and identifying outliers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "    employee_id,\n",
    "    salary,\n",
    "    PERCENT_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary) AS salary_percent_rank\n",
    "FROM employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "In this example, employees are ordered by salary, and PERCENT_RANK shows each employee’s relative standing in the salary distribution: values close to 0 are among the lowest paid, and values close to 1 are among the highest paid. When the partition has only one row, PERCENT_RANK returns 0 because both numerator and denominator reduce to 0 by definition.  \n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2 d) State and explain in brief types of Locks in database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "In MySQL (especially with InnoDB), the main lock types are shared (read) locks and exclusive (write) locks at the row or table level. Shared locks allow concurrent transactions to read the same rows but prevent those rows from being modified, while exclusive locks block both reads (that require shared locks) and writes from other transactions on the locked rows until the lock is released.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Key lock types:\n",
    "- Shared (S) lock:\n",
    "  - Acquired for read operations.\n",
    "  - Multiple transactions can hold shared locks on the same rows concurrently.\n",
    "- Exclusive (X) lock:\n",
    "  - Acquired for insert, update, or delete operations.\n",
    "  - Only one transaction can hold an exclusive lock on a resource at a time.\n",
    "- Intention locks (IS, IX):\n",
    "  - Placed at the table level to signal a transaction’s intent to acquire row-level locks, helping the engine coordinate table and row locking.\n",
    "- Table locks:\n",
    "  - Lock the entire table for read or write, used by some storage engines or explicitly via LOCK TABLES.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "The locking mechanism ensures isolation and consistency by coordinating concurrent access to rows or tables; shared locks protect data during reads, and exclusive locks protect data integrity during writes. InnoDB’s row-level locking combined with intention locks improves concurrency, reducing contention compared with coarse table-level locking.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2 e) Explain the different ways you can restrict the data in a column. Demonstrate with examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "In MySQL, data in a column can be restricted using constraints and data type definitions such as NOT NULL, DEFAULT, CHECK, UNIQUE, ENUM/SET, and FOREIGN KEY, as well as application of domain-specific data types (for example, appropriate length limits). These mechanisms ensure that only valid, consistent values are inserted or updated in the column.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Common ways with examples:\n",
    "1. NOT NULL:\n",
    "   - Ensures the column cannot store NULL.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "     CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "         emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "         name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL\n",
    "     );\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. CHECK:\n",
    "   - Enforces a Boolean condition on the column.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "     CREATE TABLE products (\n",
    "         price DECIMAL(10,2),\n",
    "         CHECK (price > 0)\n",
    "     );\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. UNIQUE:\n",
    "   - Enforces uniqueness of column values.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "     CREATE TABLE users (\n",
    "         user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "         email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE\n",
    "     );\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. ENUM / SET:\n",
    "   - Restricts values to a predefined list.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "     CREATE TABLE orders (\n",
    "         status ENUM('NEW', 'SHIPPED', 'CANCELLED') NOT NULL\n",
    "     );\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Data type and length:\n",
    "   - Using appropriate type and size limits.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "     CREATE TABLE customers (\n",
    "         country_code CHAR(2)\n",
    "     );\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. FOREIGN KEY:\n",
    "   - Restricts values to those existing in a referenced table.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "     CREATE TABLE orders (\n",
    "         customer_id INT,\n",
    "         CONSTRAINT fk_cust FOREIGN KEY (customer_id)\n",
    "             REFERENCES customers(customer_id)\n",
    "     );\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "Combining these mechanisms allows definition of strong domain rules: NOT NULL and CHECK capture presence and range conditions, UNIQUE and FOREIGN KEY enforce identity and referential integrity, and ENUM/SET ensure membership in controlled categorical values. Properly designed column constraints reduce reliance on application-side validation and prevent invalid data from being stored in the first place.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "SUBSTRING_INDEX(customer_name, ' ', 1) returns the substring before the first space, which is treated as the first name.

    "The category_stats CTE computes total_sales and total_profit for each category. The best_selling CTE selects the category with the highest total_sales, while most_profitable picks the one with the highest total_profit.

    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "The query aggregates total profit for each calendar year-month using GROUP BY on DATE_FORMAT(order_date, '%Y-%m'). Ordering by total_profit in descending order places the most profitable months first, and LIMIT 5 returns the top five months with the highest aggregated profit.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "The query groups rows by country and sums the quantity column to find the total number of products sold in each country. Sorting by total_quantity_sold in descending order and limiting to one row yields the country with the highest total quantity of products sold, which answers which country sold the most products.  \n",

    "In the correlated subquery version, for each employee row, MySQL evaluates the subquery that returns the officeCode for the Paris office and selects employees whose officeCode matches it.

    "Explanation:\n",
    "Both queries identify customers whose customerNumber does not appear in the orders table.
