    "### What is CTE and window function in SQL with example\n",
    "\n",
    "CTE (Common Table Expression) is a temporary, named result set you define at the start of a query; a window function is a function that performs calculations across a set of rows related to the current row without collapsing them into a single row. Together they are often used for cleaner, more powerful analytical SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a CTE?\n",
    "A CTE is like a readable, temporary view that exists only for the duration of one statement and is defined using the WITH keyword before the main SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE query.​\n",
    "It is commonly used to break complex queries into logical steps, reuse the same intermediate result multiple times, and work with hierarchical (recursive) data.​\n",
    "\n",
    "CTE basic syntax and example\n",
    "Basic syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "WITH cte_name AS (\n",
    "    -- intermediate query\n",
    "    SELECT column1, column2\n",
    "    FROM some_table\n",
    "    WHERE condition = true\n",
    ")\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM cte_name\n",
    "WHERE column1 > 100;\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: get employees with above-average salary using a CTE:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "WITH avg_salary AS (\n",
    "    SELECT AVG(salary) AS avg_sal\n",
    "    FROM employees\n",
    "),\n",
    "high_paid_employees AS (\n",
    "    SELECT e.employee_id,\n",
    "           e.employee_name,\n",
    "           e.salary\n",
    "    FROM employees e\n",
    "    CROSS JOIN avg_salary a\n",
    "    WHERE e.salary > a.avg_sal\n",
    ")\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM high_paid_employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here avg_salary computes a scalar average once, and high_paid_employees reuses it to filter employees."

    "### What is a window function?\n",
    "A window function calculates a value for each row based on a “window” of related rows, defined by OVER (...), but it does not group/aggregate rows away like GROUP BY does.​\n",
    "Typical window functions include aggregations such as SUM, AVG, COUNT, and ranking/analytic functions like ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, LAG, and LEAD.​\n",
    "\n",
    "Window function syntax and example\n",
    "General pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "window_function(expression) OVER (\n",
    "    [PARTITION BY partition_columns]\n",
    "    [ORDER BY sort_columns]\n",
    "    [frame_clause]\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: rank employees by salary within each department:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "    department,\n",
    "    employee_name,\n",
    "    salary,\n",
    "    DENSE_RANK() OVER (\n",
    "        PARTITION BY department\n",
    "        ORDER BY salary DESC\n",
    "    ) AS salary_rank_in_dept\n",
    "FROM employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "PARTITION BY department restarts the ranking for each department, and ORDER BY salary DESC ranks highest salaries as 1.​\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example: running total of sales by date:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "    sale_date,\n",
    "    amount,\n",
    "    SUM(amount) OVER (\n",
    "        ORDER BY sale_date\n",
    "        ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW\n",
    "    ) AS running_total\n",
    "FROM sales;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The window here is “all rows from the start up to the current row ordered by date”, so running_total is a cumulative sum.​\n",
    "\n",
    "Using CTE with window functions together\n",
    "Combining both lets you structure multi-step analytics cleanly: compute an intermediate set in a CTE, then apply window functions on top.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: from employees, first filter to active employees in a CTE, then compute department-wise average salary and rank:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "WITH active_employees AS (\n",
    "    SELECT *\n",
    "    FROM employees\n",
    "    WHERE status = 'ACTIVE'\n",
    ")\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "    department,\n",
    "    employee_name,\n",
    "    salary,\n",
    "    AVG(salary) OVER (\n",
    "        PARTITION BY department\n",
    "    ) AS dept_avg_salary,\n",
    "    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (\n",
    "        PARTITION BY department\n",
    "        ORDER BY salary DESC\n",
    "    ) AS dept_salary_rank\n",
    "FROM active_employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The CTE narrows and organizes the data; the window functions then provide per-row analytics such as per-department average and rank without further grouping."
